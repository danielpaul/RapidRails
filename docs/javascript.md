# JavaScript

RapidRails leverages modern JS libraries and frameworks such as Importmaps, Alpine.js and Hotwire. Here's a brief overview of how each is used:

## Importmaps

Importmaps allow us to control how JavaScript modules are imported in our application. In this project, the configuration for import maps is found in [config/importmap.rb](https://github.com/danielpaul/RapidRails/blob/main/config/importmap.rb). This file contains the mapping of module specifiers to URLs. To find out more see the [importmaps-rails Github](https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails).

## Alpine.js

Alpine.js is a minimal JavaScript framework used for adding interactivity to the website. To find out more see the [Alpine Docs](https://alpinejs.dev/start-here).

## Hotwire

Hotwire is a set of tools (Turbo, Stimulus, and Strada) from Basecamp for building modern web applications without much JavaScript. To find out more see the [Hotwire Docs](https://hotwired.dev/).
