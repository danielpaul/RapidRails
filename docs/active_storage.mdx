# ActiveStorage and Cloudflare R2 Buckets

Enable file uploads by setting `ENABLE_FILE_UPLOAD` in the constants file and comment in the gems for this in the Gemfile.

Cloudflare R2 buckets are used in this Rails application for two main purposes:

### File Uploads

The application uses ActiveStorage for file uploads. In the production environment, these files are stored in a bucket. This is configured in [config/storage.yml](https://github.com/danielpaul/RapidRails/blob/main/config/storage.yml).

### Sitemap Storage

The application generates a sitemap for SEO purposes. In the production environment, this sitemap is stored in a bucket. This is configured in [config/sitemap.rb](https://github.com/danielpaul/RapidRails/blob/main/config/sitemap.rb).

## Setting up an Cloudflare R2 Bucket

Follow the instructions on [this page](https://kirillplatonov.com/posts/activestorage-cloudflare-r2/) to set up a Cloudflare R2 bucket.

When creating a bucket, pick the location closest to your users & your server. This will help reduce latency.

Create two buckets:
1. Private bucket for file uploads that are accessed with presigned URLs.
2. Public bucket for the sitemap. (Enable public .r2.dev domain access in settings).

Update the secrets on the credentials file.

NOTE: ENABLE_FILE_UPLOAD must be set to true in the constants file for file uploads to work. Also enable the required gems in the Gemfile.
### Proxy uploads through Rails

To allow Cloudflare to cache uploaded files, we serve Active Storage files using the proxy route. This is configured in `config/initializers/active_storage.rb` by setting `config.active_storage.resolve_model_to_route` to `:rails_storage_proxy`.
